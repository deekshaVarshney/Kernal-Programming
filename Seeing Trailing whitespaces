According to Coding Style

Do not leave trailing whitespace at the ends of lines.  Some editors with
263 ``smart`` indentation will insert whitespace at the beginning of new lines as
264 appropriate, so you can start typing the next line of code right away.
265 However, some such editors do not remove the whitespace if you end up not
266 putting a line of code there, such as if you leave a blank line.  As a result,
267 you end up with lines containing trailing whitespace.

To double-check if all trailing spaces are gone, use:

    Type / $ to find them. If there are some, vim would highlight them for you.
    Use colours to highlight them: :highlight ws ctermbg=red guibg=red :match ws /\s\+$/
    Use visible characters (source): :set encoding=utf-8 :set listchars=trail:Â· :set list.
